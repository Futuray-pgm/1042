# 1042 Gameplay

## Inital notes

- This game is designed to be a survival adventure game, thus it is reccomended to try to figure things out first.
- The game machanics in 1042 are not the same as most games on the luanti engine, thus I will write a gameplay manual.

## Breaking nodes
### WARNING NOT COMPLEATE
Some nodes, like dirt and plants, can be broken easily by hand. Some nodes, like wood or stone, must be broken with a tool.

## Mining
### WARNING NOT COMPLEATE
Ores are worthless in their natrual state, they must be broken into nuggets in order to be processed.

## Starting fires
This is a fairly simple task, find some an iorn nugget and some flint. When you have found some flint, take it and put it right next to the node you want to light. After doing this you start to beat the flint with the iorn nugget. This should produce a lot of sparks and the fire should ignite after a few attempts. It can take a while sometimes so don't give up to quickly.
