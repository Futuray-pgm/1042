# 1042 Gameplay

## Inital notes

- This game is designed to be a survival adventure game, thus it is reccomended to try to figure things out first.
- The game machanics in 1042 are not the same as most games on the luanti engine, thus I will write a gameplay manual.


## Controles

Controles are slightly different in 1042. To eat/use some items you use the `aux1` key insted of rightclick/leftclick this is so you can still treat items as nodes.


## Breaking nodes

Some nodes can be broken by hand, others require tools

### Stones

Stone nodes must be broken with a pick

### Woods

Wood nodes must be broken with an axe


## Crafting

Crafting is done in the 3x3 slots in the inventory. There is not a crafting guid in this phase, though I would like to add it soon.


## Cooking

If you get some raw food, like pork from a pig, you can cook it. Cooking is done by placing raw food near a burning node. After a given ionterval the food will cook.


## Mining

Ores are worthless in their natrual state, they must be broken into nuggets in order to be processed. This is done by mining them with a pick. Once mined they can be aranged into a 3x3 square in the crafting slots in your invintory to make a nugget block.


## Refining metals

Nugget blocks can be melted by placing them beside a block of burning charcoal, when they start flowing they will form blocks of slag, this must be mined so it continues to flow. Some of the flowing metal should form into ingots, if they do not you just had bad luck and should try again.


## Starting fires
This is a fairly simple task, find some an iron nugget and some flint. When you have found some flint, take it and put it right next to the node you want to light. After doing this you start to beat the flint with the iron nugget. This should produce a lot of sparks and the fire should ignite after a few attempts. It can take a while sometimes so don't give up to quickly. Some things like wood burn to charcoal, this can be used to melt metals.


## Tools

Tools can be crafted as follows:

### Axe

Axe is made with three flint on top and two sticks for handle.

### Pick

Pick is made with three iron and two sticks for handle.

### Sword

Sword is made with two iron ingots for a blade and one stick for a handle.
